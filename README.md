# PAN-Card
A Computer Vision based project to process a PAN Card image to check its authenticity.

```
We use the structural_integrity module from the skimage package to check the provided image data against a generic template of a valid PAN Card. After checking and validating, it is recommended to run the PAN though the Income Tax database to check for fraud.
